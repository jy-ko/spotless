# Spotless Clone - manage your chores

Motivation: 

I found it quite challenging to keep track of the routine/non-routine tasks that need to be done for the upkeep of the house, e.g. servicing the airconditioning units. There is an existing mobile app called Spotless that aims to achieve this objective, so I have decided to use the same name for the application.

The questions I wanted to answer were:
- When was the last time the task was done? 
- When should be the next one? 
- What are the pending tasks for today?

The user can:
- create, read, update, delete a Task
- create, read, update, delete a Room (area) 
- set last cleaned date for a Task
- set recurring frequency for a Task
- view all tasks on a monthly calendar in the dashboard
- view all tasks that need to be completed today
- mark tasks as 'complete' on the 'Today's to-do' page

Built with: 
* Ruby on Rails 

Gems:
* recurring-select
