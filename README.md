# Spotless Clone

When was the last time you descaled the coffee machine? or deep-cleaned the air conditioning units? 

Inspiration: I have found it quite challenging to keep track of the non-routine tasks that need to be done for the upkeep of the house. When was it last cleaned? When should be the next one? 

The user can:
- create, read, update, delete a Task
- create, read, update, delete a Room (area) 
- set last cleaned date of a Task
- set recurring frequency of a Task
- view all tasks on a calendar in the dashboard
- view all tasks that need to be completed today
- mark tasks as 'complete' on the 'Today's to-do' page
